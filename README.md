# Housing-Prices-Prediction

This is a project that entails studying the factors that affect housing prices using given information on real estate properties that was collected over the past few months.

The project also entails creating Regression models that would allow accurate prediction of the sale of prices upon being provided with the predictor variables i.e. the factors affecting housing prices.

## Description
This project uses Exploratory Data Analysis to study the different factors affecting housing prices.

This project also contains 5 predictive models created using python and it's libraries. The regression models include:

i.) Multiple Linear Regression

ii.) Quantile Regression

iii.) Ridge Regression

iv.) Lasso Regression

v.) Elastic Net Regression

## Usage
Depending on the different factors provided, the models are built to predict the housing prices for a real estate company.

## Installation
Install Python and it's libraries in order to understand this project and use the models.
